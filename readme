Used POSIX semaphores because thread pooling on sem_wait() is much more user firendly, cleared with bhatia in class.
Did not include any program arguments because the instructions didn't list it default value for input is file named test.
Otherwise include file as argument.

Hoare really doesn't like to open up files in a timely manner, so there is a good chance the program will crash because
a new output file has yet to be declared.
